# Data-Driven Testing with Selenium and Excel
This code snippet demonstrates a data-driven approach to test automation using Selenium WebDriver with Python. The test scenario involves logging into a website using multiple sets of credentials stored in an Excel spreadsheet and validating the login process.

# Setup
### 1.Selenium WebDriver Installation
* Ensure you have Selenium WebDriver installed. You can install it via pip:
  >pip install selenium

### 2.WebDriver Setup
* Download the appropriate WebDriver executable (e.g., ChromeDriver for Google Chrome) and ensure it's in your system PATH.

### 3.Excel Utility Class (XLUtils)
* There is a custom utility class named XLUtils which is responsible for interacting with the Excel spreadsheet (LoginData.xlsx) to read and write data. 
* Ensure this utility class (XLUtils.py) is available in your project directory and contains the necessary methods (getRowCount, getColumnCount, readData, writeData) for Excel operations.

## Execution
* Run the script (python filename.py). 
* View the console output for test results (Testcase Passed or Testcase Failed).
* Check the Excel file for updated test results in the specified column (Sheet1).

## Notes
* Ensure the Sheet1 in the Excel file matches the actual sheet name containing login data.
* Adjust the WebDriver instantiation (webdriver.Chrome()) based on the browser you intend to automate.
* Customize the Excel file path (path) and column indices (i, 1 for email and i, 2 for password) to match your specific Excel layout.
